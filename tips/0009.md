## Transparent proxy configuration in Windows
(Windows 透明代理設置過程)

Here is what I did to make it work.

1. ~~Use `OpenVPN tap driver` for~~
   ~~[Win7](https://build.openvpn.net/downloads/releases/tap-windows-9.24.2-I601-Win7.exe) or~~
   ~~[Win10](https://build.openvpn.net/downloads/releases/tap-windows-9.24.2-I601-Win10.exe)~~
   ~~to install a `virtual network adapter`(use `NDIS5` drivers).~~

   Download [wintun](https://www.wintun.net/) driver and extract file
   `c:\wintun-0.14.1.zip\wintun\bin\amd64\wintun.dll`
   to `c:\windows\system32\`.

2. ~~Name it as `taplan`.~~
3. ~~Assign `10.0.0.33` to your network adapter named `taplan`. Use `255.255.255.0` as subnet mask.~~
4. Have a socks server or use public server you owned to do a ssh tunnel socks proxy connection.

   I recommend using my [overtls](https://github.com/ShadowsocksR-Live/overtls) proxy utility,
   where its client acts as a local `SOCKS5` server.

   If you don't have a socks proxy, you need a public server.
   You can use putty to establish an ssh connection along with a tunnel which acts as a socks proxy.
   Sample command is something likes `ssh -D 1080 -f -C -q -N ip_of_ssh_server`, so here my command is:
   ```
   ssh -D 1080 -f -C -q -N someone@ip_of_ssh_server -p 23456 -i C:\Users\myaccount\Documents\my.key
   ```
   > If you can't find `ssh` command, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases).

   After that, you have a socks proxy on your `localhost` at port `1080`.

5. Check your socks proxy with `Firefox` by pointing `localhost:1080` as socks proxy.
If you have an internet connection then so far so good.
   > Or use [curl](https://curl.se/windows/) to test it in command prompt:
   > ```
   > curl --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080 https://google.com
   > ```

6. ~~Download `tun2socks` from [prebuilt windows binaries](https://github.com/ssrlive/badvpn/releases).~~
   ~~For our situation, I used `badvpn-tun2socks-windows-x86_64.zip` file.~~

   ~~Extract `badvpn-tun2socks.exe` file to somewhere in system `PATH` and rename it as `t2s`.~~

   Download `tun2socks` from [prebuilt windows binaries](https://github.com/xjasonlyu/tun2socks/releases).
   For our situation, I used [tun2socks-windows-amd64.zip](https://github.com/xjasonlyu/tun2socks/releases/download/v2.5.1/tun2socks-windows-amd64.zip) file.

   Extract `tun2socks-windows-amd64.exe` file to somewhere in system `PATH` and rename it as `t2s-go`.

7. Configure `tun2socks` to make your `taplan` adapter to use socks proxy.

   Enter command prompt with admin privileges and type:

   ~~t2s --tundev "tap0901:taplan:10.0.0.33:10.0.0.0:255.255.255.0" --netif-ipaddr 10.0.0.1 --netif-netmask 255.255.255.0 --socks-server-addr 127.0.0.1:1080~~

   ```
   t2s-go -device tun://taplan -proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
   netsh interface ipv4 set address name=taplan source=static addr=10.0.0.33 mask=255.255.255.0 gateway=10.0.0.1
   netsh interface ipv4 set dnsservers name=taplan source=static address=8.8.8.8 register=primary
   ```
   Now you have a `virtual network adapter` named as `taplan` which uses the socks proxy configured as your localhost to connect to internet.
   All requests forwarded to this adapter will tunnel through your public/remote server.

8. Configure your internet routes.

   In command prompt type:
   ```
   route PRINT -4
   ```
   This will show you current routes. The default gateway is the top one. Note that IP.

   ```
   route CHANGE 0.0.0.0 MASK 0.0.0.0 your_current_gateway_ip METRIC 400
   route ADD ip_of_ssh_server your_current_gateway_ip METRIC 60
   route ADD 0.0.0.0 MASK 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 METRIC 50
   ```

   > If your network not support IPv6, you must disable IPv6 in your `taplan` adapter and real `outgoing` network adapter.
   > To detect if your network support IPv6, you can use `ping -6 ipv6.test-ipv6.com` command.
   > If you can't ping it, then your network not support IPv6.
   > To disable IPv6, you can set it like this
   >

   >
   > to the `taplan` adapter and real `outgoing` network adapter.

   Now all your internet traffic will be using `10.0.0.1` as gateway which is configured in a `virtual network adapter`.
