## Rust reqwest: how to wait until the page is fully loaded?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72082257/rust-reqwest-how-to-wait-until-the-page-is-fully-loaded

Reqwest does not do this, it only loads the data at a given URL and nothing more. What you ask for is what a browser displays when loading a webpage which will include loading other assets, embedding pages, running scripts, etc.

You need a full-on browser to get this functionality, which will require a web-driver (like selenium). Just looking around for Rust solutions, maybe [fantoccini](https://crates.io/crates/fantoccini) or [chromiumoxide](https://crates.io/crates/chromiumoxide) or [headless_chrome](https://crates.io/crates/headless_chrome) catch your fancy.
